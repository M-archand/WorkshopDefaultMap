# WorkshopDefaultMap
A CounterStrikeSharp plugin to set default map after server restart.

Installation:
1) Download the latest [release](https://github.com/M-archand/WorkshopDefaultMap/releases).
2) Extract the addons folder.
3) Update the Workshop Map ID in `addons/counterstrikesharp/configs/WorkshopDefaultMap/WorkshopDefaultMap.json` to the map you want to use.
4) Upload the addons folder to your root folder `/csgo/`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> • Make sure the map is in the workshop collection you set using the `host_workshop_collection` variable.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> • This version isn't really any different from Cruze's version, it just removes some unnecessary logging and is compiled against CSS v276.
